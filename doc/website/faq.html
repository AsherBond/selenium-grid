		<dt><b>Would you recommend using Selenium Grid for performance/Load testing?</b><br/><br/></dt>
		  <dd>
			<p>
			  Selenium Grid is not designed for performance and load testing, but
			  very efficient web acceptance/functional testing.
			  The main reason for this is that conducting performance/load testing
			  with real browser is a pretty bad idea as it is hard/expensive to
			  scale the load and the actual load is very inconsistent.
            </p><p>
			  For load/performance testing I would advise using tools like JMeter,
			  Grinder or httperf. What you can do though, is reuse your selenium
			  tests to record the use cases you will use for your load testing.
			</p><p>
			  To simulate 200 concurrent users for instance, you would need 200 concurrent browsers 
			  with a load testing framework based on Selenium Grid. 
			  Even if you use Firefox on Linux (so the most
			  efficient setup) you will probably need at least 10 machines to
			  generate that kind of load. Quite insane when JMeter/Grinder/httperf
			  can generate the same kind of load with a single machine.
