- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P
  body: RSpec runs every example in a new instance of Object, mixing in the behaviour
    necessary to run examples. Because this behaviour gets mixed in, it can get mixed
    in to an instance of any class at all.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P
  body: This is something that you would hardly ever use, but there is one common
    use case for it - inheriting from Test::Unit::TestCase. RSpec's Rails plugin uses
    this feature to provide access to all of the features that are available for Test::Unit
    within RSpec examples.
