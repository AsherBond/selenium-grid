    </p>
    <p>-Extract the downloaded file on your computer.  We will need to setup some enviroment variables in your PATH</p>
    <p>-Define EC2_HOME.  This the root location of where you exctracted your EC2 command line tools.  Update your profile
    to include variable EC2_HOME</p>
    <p>-Once you have created the variable EC2_HOME, add the following line to your PATH-> $PATH:$EC2_HOME\bin.  This will 
    add the command line tools to your path</p>
    <p>-Add the Private Key to your environment.  In your profile set the Environment Variable "export EC2_PRIVATE_KEY=~/.ec2/pk-HKZYKTAIG2ECMXYIBH3HXV4ZBZQ55CLO.pem "</p>
