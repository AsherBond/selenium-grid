Summary of changes from v0.9.3 to v0.9.4
========================================

Philippe Hanrigou <http://ph7spot.com>:

  * Sample parallel test suite using Ruby/RSpec

  * Converted Demo to TestNG

  * Made Selenium Grid work with Selenium 0.9.3 RC.
    Latest RC has changed the way the session IDs are set and 
    is now using GUIDs.

  * Allow custom arguments to be passed to RCs at startup

    ant -DseleniumArgs="..." launch-remote-control
    
  * Bug Fix: Can handle commands with huge text payload.
    Use POST not GET to transfer commands to RCs to be able 
    to process type commands with a huge text

  * Bug Fix: Properly handle international characters.
    Fixed HttpClient wrapper to assume UTF-8 as Charset is 
    not explicitely set.
