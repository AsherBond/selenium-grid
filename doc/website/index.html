        Selenium Grid is an open-source tool that dramatically speeds up web 
        testing by leveraging your existing computing infrastructure. 
      </p><p>
        It allows you to run multiple tests in parallel and on multiple
        machines, cutting down the time required for running web acceptance 
        tests.

          Selenium Grid is a tool that dramatically speeds up web 
          testing by leveraging your existing computing infrastructure. 
          It allows you to easily run multiple tests in parallel, on multiple
          machines, in an heterogeneous enviroment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the excellent 
          <a href="http://www.openqa.org/selenium/">Selenium</a> web 
          testing tool, Selenium Grid allows you to run multiple instances 
          of Selenium Remote Control in parallel. Even better, it makes all 
          these Selenium Remote Controls appear as a single one, so your tests 
          do not have to worry about the actual infrastructure. Selenium Grid
          cuts down on the time required to run a Selenium test suite to a 
          fraction of the time that a single instance of Selenium instance 
          would take to run.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last but not least, Selenium Grid is easy to use and simple to install.
