- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P
  body: Creates and registers an instance of a Spec::DSL::Behaviour (or a subclass).
    The instantiated behaviour class depends on the directory of the file calling
    this method. For example, Spec::Rails will use different classes for specs living
    in <tt>spec/models</tt>, <tt>spec/helpers</tt>, <tt>spec/views</tt> and <tt>spec/controllers</tt>.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P
  body: 'It is also possible to override autodiscovery of the behaviour class with
    an options Hash as the last argument:'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB
  body: "  describe &quot;name&quot;, :behaviour_type =&gt; :something_special do \
    ...\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P
  body: The reason for using different behaviour classes is to have different matcher
    methods available from within the <tt>describe</tt> block.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P
  body: See Spec::DSL::BehaviourFactory#add_behaviour_class for details about how
    to register special Spec::DSL::Behaviour implementations.
