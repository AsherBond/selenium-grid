<h1>Getting Started with Selenium Grid - Running the Demo</h1>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>To run Selenium Grid you will need</p>
<ul>
    <li>Java 5+ JDK</li>
    <li>Ant 1.7.x</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Install these on your machine if you do not have them
    already. Do not forget to add them to your <code>PATH</code>.
</p>

<p>
    You will also need a binary distribution of the Selenium Grid.
    You can either:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Download it from the <a href="http://seleniumgrid.thoughtworks.com/documentation/download.html">Selenium Grid website</a></li>
    <li>
        Build it from a SVN checkout (only for ThoughtWorks staff <em>for now</em>):
        <ol>
            <li><code>svn co https://mingle01.thoughtworks.com/svn/selenium_grid &lt;project root&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code>cd &lt;project root&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code>ant dist-bin</code></li>
            <li><code>cd dist/selenium-grid-1.0</code></li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    From now on, all documented commands are to be launched from the binary distribution directory.
</p>

<h2 id="tests_in_sequence">Running the Tests in Sequence on Firefox on a Single Machine</h2>

<p>
    Go to the selenium distribution directory and launch in a new terminal:
</p>
<pre class="command">ant launch-hub</pre>
<p>
    Check out that the Hub is running by looking at
    the console at
    <a href="http://localhost:4444/console">http://localhost:4444/console</a>
</p>

<p>
    In a new terminal on the same machine launch:
</p>
<pre class="command">ant launch-remote-control</pre>
<p>
    Go back to the Hub console at
    <a href="http://localhost:4444/console">http://localhost:4444/console</a>.
    Now you should have one remote control listed as available. You should see something like:
</p>

<div class="screenshot">
    <h2>Available Remote Controls</h2>
    <table border='1'>
        <tr>
            <th>Host</th>
            <th>Port</th>
            <th>Environment</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>localhost</td>
            <td>5555</td>
            <td>*chrome</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>
<p>Then run in a new terminal:</p>
<pre class="command">ant run-demo-in-sequence</pre>

<p>
    Four Selenium tests will then run in sequence against your remote control.
    Take note of how long it took to run the whole test suite ï¿½ this will give you a baseline.
    To be honest, there is nothing really exciting about this part of the demo. You
    can achieve exactly the same thing with a traditional remote control. This is just to get
    you started, since the whole point of the Selenium grid is to run tests in parallel.
    That's exactly what we are going to do next.
</p>
<p>
    Note: if you want to understand what the selenium test is about, or what is going on under the
    cover, have a look at the <code>demo</code> sub-project in the source distribution.
</p>

<h2>Running the Tests in Parallel on Firefox on a Single Machine</h2>

<p>
    First make sure that you already have the Hub and a remote control running.
    If not, follow the instructions described in the
    <a href="#tests_in_sequence">Running the Tests in Sequence</a> section.
</p>

<p>
    Now let's start three more remote control instances. Launch them in separate terminals:
</p>
    <pre class="command">    ant -Dport=5556 launch-remote-control
  ant -Dport=5557 launch-remote-control
  ant -Dport=5558 launch-remote-control</pre>
<p>
    You should now see a total of four remote controls available in the Hub console
    http://localhost:4444/console:
</p>

<div class="screenshot">
    <h2>Available Remote Controls</h2>
    <table border='1'>
        <tr> <th>Host</th> <th>Port</th> <th>Environment</th> </tr>
        <tr> <td>localhost</td> <td>5555</td> <td>*chrome</td> </tr> <tr>
        <td>localhost</td> <td>5556</td> <td>*chrome</td> </tr>
        <tr> <td>localhost</td> <td>5557</td> <td>*chrome</td> </tr>
        <tr> <td>localhost</td> <td>5558</td> <td>*chrome</td> </tr>
    </table>
</div>
  <p>
    Launch the tests in parallel in a new terminal:
  </p>
  <pre class="command">ant run-demo-in-parallel</pre>
  <p>
    The total run time should be significantly lower than when running the
    test in sequence.
  </p><p>
    You can then experiment with bringing down one or two remote controls and check that the total
    run time is directly proportional to the number of available remote controls.
  </p>

<h2>Running the Tests in Parallel on Multiple Machines</h2>

  <p>
    Until now we have been running the hub and the remote controls on the same machine.
    This was quick and easy to set up, but ultimately we want to run the remote controls
    on multiple machines. Now let's try to distribute the whole grid on 3 different machines.
  </p>
  <p>Let's consider the following setup:</p>
  <p><img src="resources/Multiple Machine Demo Setup.png" alt="Multiple Machine Setup Diagram"/></p>
  <p>
    In this setup one machine (<code>hub.thoughtworks.com</code>) will run the Hub and drive
    the selenium tests. The two other machines will run the remote controls
    (2 remote controls per machine).
  </p><p>
    If you cannot assign neat host names like rc1.thoughtworks.com for your tests, specity the appropriate TCP/IP number instead.
  </p><p>
    On each machine, run commands similar to the ones described in the diagram above.
    Of course you will need to change the host names to match the one for your own
    machine. You can use IP addresses too if you prefer.
  </p><p>
    This setup illustrates that you can run the hub and the remote controls on arbitrary machines.
    When you do so though, you need to provide a lot more information when launching a remote control.
    You need to launch it with:
  </p>
  <pre class="command">ant -Dport=&lt;port&gt; -Dhost=&lt;hostname&gt; -DhubURL=&lt;hub url&gt; launch-remote-control</pre>
  <p>Where:</p>
  <dl>
      <dt><code>port</code></dt>
        <dd>Port that the remote control will be listening at. Must be unique on the machine the remote control runs on.</dd>
      <dt><code>hostname</code></dt>
        <dd>
            Hostname or IP address of the machine the remote control runs on. Must be visible from the Hub machine.
            Note: This information could be inferred as it is always referring to the machine the remote control runs
            on. It might not be required in future versions of the Selenium Grid.
        </dd>
      <dt><code>hub url</code></dt>
        <dd>
            Which hub the remote control should register/unregister to. If the hub is running on
            hostname <code>my.hub.com</code>, this url will be <code>http://my.hub.com:4444</code>
        </dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
    Once you are successful in replicating a setup similar to the one described above, point your
    browser to the Hub console (<code>http://hub.thoughtworks.com:4444/console</code>).
    Check that all the remote controls did register properly. Available remote controls list should be
     similar to:
  </p>
<div class="screenshot">
    <h2>Available Remote Controls</h2>
    <table border='1'>
        <tr> <th>Host</th> <th>Port</th> <th>Environment</th> </tr>
        <tr> <td>rc1.thoughtworks.com</td> <td>5555</td> <td>*chrome</td> </tr>
        <tr> <td>rc1.thoughtworks.com</td> <td>5556</td> <td>*chrome</td> </tr>
        <tr> <td>rc2.thoughtworks.com</td> <td>5555</td> <td>*chrome</td> </tr>
        <tr> <td>rc2.thoughtworks.com</td> <td>5556</td> <td>*chrome</td> </tr>
    </table>
</div>
  <p>You can then launch the tests and enjoy the dance of browsers popping up on the two machines:</p>
  <pre class="command">ant run-demo-in-parallel</pre>
  <p>
      The total run time is likely to be slighly higher than when running the tests in parallel on the same
      machine but still significantly faster than when running the tests in sequence.  As you scale
      the number of remote controls upward to the point of stressing a single RC machine, as you would expect, the performance
      advantage moves towards a distributed environment.
  </p>

<h2>Running the Tests with Remote Controls Providing Different Environments</h2>

  <p>
      Until now we have distributed the remote controls, but all of them were equivalent.
      For instance, when the Selenium test was openning a new session for the Firefox browser,
      it had no idea whether it ended up running on Windows, Linux or Mac OS.
  </p><p>
    Maybe this is exactly what you want to achieve. However it might end up being hard to figure
    out that a specific Selenium test is failing one time out of ten just because it exercises
    a bug only happening on Mac OS. In any case, if you want better control over the environment
    your tests run on, you can use the <dfn>Selenium Hub Environments</dfn>.
  </p><p>
    The idea is simple:
  </p>
  <ol>
      <li>
          <p>
            When you start a Remote Control you define which <dfn>Hub environment</dfn> it provides.
            Let's say <code>Firefox on Windows</code>:    
          </p>
          <pre>ant -Denvironment="Firefox on Windows" launch-remote-control</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p>
              In your Selenium test, when instantiating the Selenium driver, pass the
              <dfn>Hub environment</dfn> in lieu of the browser string: </p>

          <p>For instance, if you are writing your tests in Java change the following:</p>
          <pre>new DefaultSelenium("localhost", 4444, <strong>'*chrome'</strong>, 'http://amazon.com');</pre>
          <p>to:
          <pre>new DefaultSelenium("localhost", 4444, <strong>'Firefox on Windows'</strong>, 'http://amazon.com');</pre>
      </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
      The Selenium Hub will then make sure to provide the test with a remote control that registered with
      this specific <dfn>Hub environment</dfn>. It will also substitute the browser string on the fly
      before invoking the actual remote control. In this way you can use any official distribution of the
      Selenium control in your Grid ï¿½ no modifications are required.
  </p>
  <p>Let's be a little bit more concrete and consider the following setup:</p>
  <p><img src="resources/Multiple Environment Demo Setup.png" alt="Multiple Machine Setup Diagram"/></p>

  <p>
    In this setup <code>rc1.thoughtworks.com</code> starts 2 remote controls providing the
    <code>Firefox on Windows</code> <dfn>Hub Environment</dfn>. In contrast, <code>rc2.thoughtworks.com</code>
    registers 2 remote controls providing the <code>Firefox on Mac</code> <dfn>Hub Environment</dfn>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now try to replicate the setup described above. Keep in mind that the remote controls can
    register with whatever environment they fancy. It is their reponsibility to play nice with
    the Hub. This means that even if you are running the demo on Linux, you can totally start
    remote controls pretending to provide the <code>Firefox on Windows</code> or
    <code>Firefox on Mac</code> environment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Once all this is started, take a look at the Selenium Hub console. You should see something like:
  </p>
  <div class="screenshot">
  <h2>Available Remote Controls</h2>
  <table border='1'>
      <tr> <th>Host</th> <th>Port</th> <th>Environment</th> </tr>
      <tr> <td>rc1.thoughtworks.com</td> <td>5555</td> <td>Firefox on Windows</td> </tr>
      <tr> <td>rc1.thoughtworks.com</td> <td>5556</td> <td>Firefox on Windows</td> </tr>
      <tr> <td>rc2.thoughtworks.com</td> <td>5555</td> <td>Firefox on Mac</td> </tr>
      <tr> <td>rc2.thoughtworks.com</td> <td>5556</td> <td>Firefox on Mac</td> </tr>
  </table>
  </div>
  <p>
      We are now going to run in parallel a Selenium test suite that runs the same test but
      requiring different browsers. The test suite consists of 2 tests requesting
      explicitly the <code>Firefox on Windows</code> environment and one test
      requesting the <code>Firefox on Mac</code> environment.
  </p>
  <p>
      So the first 2 tests will run only on the machine registering its remote controls as
      providing <code>Firefox on Windows</code>. The last one will run only on the machine
      registering its remote controls as providing <code>Firefox on Mac</code>.
      You can make sure that this is what is hapenning by running:
  </p>
  <pre class="command">ant run-demo-for-multiple-environments</pre>

  <h2>What's Next?</h2>
    <p>
        You are now familiar with Selenium Grid usage and concepts. In case you have not done it yet,
        take a look at the demo code (you will find it in the <code>demo</code>
        sub-folder of the source distribution). Then deploy your own Selenium Grid at work
        and get it to run your build in less than five minutes. You do not need a million machines to
        get started. Five powerful machines  running 10+ remote controls each should suffice to divide
        your build time by 50!
